Original concept and implementation by SpysyWeeb (github.com/SpysyWeeb)

Smooth Stops. The smooth landing is produced entirely in longcontrol, at
control rate, by feathering the brake all the way down to a *true* standstill and
only then handing off to the standstill hold clamp. See SmoothStopController for
the rationale. Gated behind the SmoothStops toggle: disabled means byte-for-byte
stock longcontrol behavior.

  """
  Owns the final approach to a stop, inside longcontrol (control rate, true v_ego).

  The harsh "headbang" stop is the stock handoff: the moment the plan's speed drops
  below vEgoStopping, the state machine jumps to the `stopping` state and ramps the
  command to stopAccel (-2.0 m/s^2) -- while the car is usually still rolling. This
  controller instead keeps the car in a closed-loop *settle* feather that decelerates
  it smoothly to a true standstill, and only lets the hold clamp engage once stopped:

    settle()       -- fade the braking level you *entered* with linearly down to the kiss as
                      v -> 0 (entry-anchored: no step at engage by construction, whatever the
                      plan was doing); firm up toward the decel required to stop behind the
                      lead (lead-aware "how swiftly"); ratchet firmer if the car stops making
                      progress (anti-creep), escalating faster the tighter the remaining gap
                      to a lead is -- a stall that's eating into a close gap is urgent, not
                      just uncomfortable. Only the settle pressure is feathered -- braking
                      demanded by the MPC's plan (which owns collision avoidance) is applied
                      immediately, so full braking force is never delayed.
    want_hold()    -- request the stopping/hold clamp only once v_ego is at/below
                      STANDSTILL_SPEED (or the car reports standstill), so the clamp lands
                      on a stopped car. Pure query, no state.
    arm_hold()     -- called by longcontrol on every transition into the stopping state
                      (including the stock off/starting edges that bypass want_hold), so
                      the hold always starts with a fresh release debounce.
    hold_release() -- once holding, require should_stop to stay false for HOLD_RELEASE_FRAMES
                      before releasing, so a one-frame plan flicker can't blip the brake.

  Knobs (STOP_KISS_DECEL end-gentleness, ANTI_CREEP_RATE) are conservative defaults to
  be tuned on-device.
