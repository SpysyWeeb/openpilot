Lead Reaction Tuning: one global longitudinal-feel toggle that makes sunnypilot
respond quicker on both gas and brakes. When enabled it applies two effects
together:

- Lead reaction scales the lead's acceleration-decay time constant (aLeadTau)
  down, so the MPC projects the lead's braking (or pull-away) as persisting
  longer and engages the response earlier and more progressively instead of late
  and abrupt (5x stock).
- Launch response tightens the v_desired smoothing time constant used at takeoff,
  improving the tracking of the model's pull-off from a stop (4x stock). The
  planner blends this back to stock above a low speed so highway following is
  untouched.

Disabled reproduces stock behavior exactly.
